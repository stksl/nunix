implement file creation, optimize bitmap. implement fast and easy cluster preparation 
                                            (for newly allocated clusters)



Made a Directory handler clusters. starting cluster has a special header (StartingHandlerCluster). 
there is a class for that handler (DirHandlerCluster), inherits Cluster.

also created a DirClusterHandler for optimised operations specifically for directory handlers.
